Well, how about that? You went out of your way to find me, and you did it!

Welcome to humans.txt, the little bit of this site dedicated to the strange person behind the curtain. Their name is Chris. Don't make eye contact or any sudden movements. 

It's been a privilege to work with the artist, and if you like my work here, stop by and check out the rest of it -- maybe there's something I can do to help you too!
